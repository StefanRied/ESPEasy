This is a fork of the ESPEasy development repro at the mega branch: https://github.com/letscontrolit/ESPEasy
I use it to rebrand it a bit to my application.
I am also experimenting with new plugins and bug fixes to some pluging.
All work is public.
Please refer to the licence and copyright of the original work by Letscontrolit.
Thanks


If you don't get it compiled, just download my binary from the build
